# Optimal mitigation for epidemic outbreaks
Repository for the paper "A simple criterion to  design optimal  non-pharmaceutical interventions for mitigating epidemic outbreaks"
by Marco Tulio Angulo, Fernando Casta√±os, Rodrigo Moreno-Morton, Jorge X. Velasco, and Jaime A. Moreno

The repository contains two files: sir.py and OptimalNPIs.ipynb. The first file contains functions that calculate the optimal NPIs. The second is a Jupyter notebook that illustrates how to calculate the optimal intervention for mitigating epidemic outbreaks using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model.
Optimal interventions minimize their effective duration (hence minimizing their economic and societal impact) and ensure that disease prevalence does not exceed a user-defined maximum Imax (representing the hospital capacity).
